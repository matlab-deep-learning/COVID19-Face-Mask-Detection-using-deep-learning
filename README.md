**Background**

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain of disease in humans discovered in 2019 that has never been identified in the past. 
Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illness in patients ranging from common cold to advanced respiratory syndromes such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-COV).
Many people are currently affected and are being treated across the world causing a global pandemic. 
Several countries have declared a national emergency and have quarantined millions of people. 

To be a part of the worldwide trend, I've created a CORONA mask detection deep learning model.
It includes semi-auto data labeling, model training, and GPU code generation for real-time inference.
Our MathWorks Korea staffs were willing to share their selfies(Non-distributable) with masks while working from home, so I can create the dataset easily.   
Unfortunately, the dataset is not distributable, so you need to create your own dataset for training your own model. I've included some of sample data in SampleMaskData folder.

Demo Workflow
-------------   
<img src="/images/image2.png" width="70%" height="70%" title="Demo Workflow" alt="Demo Workflow"></img><br/>
* Label image  
  * Automated labeling with pretrained model
  * Use image Labeler for interactive process automation
* Train Object detection model    
  * SSD(Single-Shot Multibox Detector)
  * YOLOv2(You Only Look Once v2)
*  Generate CUDA mex for inference speed acceleration   
 
Part1 - Prepare Data
-------------
<img src="/images/image3.png" width="30%" height="30%" title="Ground Truth Labeling" alt="Ground Truth Labeling"></img><br/>

#### COVID19_LabelMaskAutomation.mlx
This file includes the basic of ground truth labeling and how we semi-automate the ground truth labeling with pretrained open source model.

Part2 - Train Model
-------------
#### COVID19_TrainMaskDetection.mlx
This file includes the entire training process from data augmentation, architecture creation and evaluation.
It includes high-level APIs for SSD(Single Shot Multibox Detector) and YOLOv2(You Only Look Once) network architecture for the comparison.

If you complete the training, we need to test the trained model for still image, video and live webcam streaming data.
For the each task instances, see below codes for the model running.
#### COVID19_TestStillImage.mlx
- Test trained model for still image.
#### COVID19_VideoRunning.mlx
- Test trained model for existing video.
#### COVID19_LiveWebcamMask.mlx
- Test trained model for live webcam object image. The example requires MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams. If you do not have the required support packages installed, then the software provides a download link.

Part3 - Deploy System
-------------

### COVID19_TrainMaskDetection.mlx
In the training code, few lines of code is included for code generation.
